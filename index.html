        <li>Set up a stopwatch!</li>

    <section class="sectionOne">
        <h3>#1 Remove Distractions!</h3>
        <p>Setting your phone out of site - behind your computer, under your comforter/pillow, a different room</p>
        <p>Even having your phone in your pocket can be a huge distraction</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sectionTwo">
        <h3>#2 Set up a Stopwatch!</h3>
        <p>Time yourself with completely undistracted work and see how long it lasts. Progress the work timer as time goes 
            and jot it down</p>
        <p>
            For example, work for 10 minute then progress to 15 minutes then to 20 minutes, etc... etc...</p>
        <p>Allow yourself to stop once you're feeling you're not being productive anymore</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sectionThree">
        <h3>#3 Know yourself | 20 minutes is greater than 1 hour</h3>
        <em>Adding onto last section, a 20 minute non-distracted study is way more affective than a 1 hour distracted study</em>
        <p>If you're able to power through 8 hours straight without being distracted, then you're a legend & keep doing what you're doing. If you're someone 
            who easily gets off track, and 10 minutes into a study and the phone's already out, then good on you too!</p>
        <em>Apri park is someone who can power through a 8 hour session and this section reminded me of him</em>

            <p> Everyone is different and even 10 minutes of studying undistracted is a lot</p>
            <p> Every break, you're adding 10 minutes to your study sheet. Those 10's add up very quick. <br> <em>Unless it's 
                a 10 minute study and 3 hour break, then maybe 20 minutes of work is all you're getting for that day
            </s></em></p>
        <h4>#3a. Your 10 minutes can be improved with practice!</h4>
        <li><em>Watch first 8/9 minutes to understand</em></li>
        <iframe width="370px" height="250px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IlU-zDU6aQ0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Anyways, assuming now you've watched the video, the title means that getting 20 minutes worth of quality work can be greater than sitting at a spot - 
            "working" for an hour while having your thoughts clouded. </p>
        
        <p>It's better to take that break whenever you feel like it's time to break. Instead of pushing yourself and ending up with sloppy work, 
        take that 5-10 minute break. Get up & go walk, find a 
        different spot to work at...</p>
        <p><strong>#3b. Let your brain rest and put in good work once your break is finished</strong></p>
        <p>To summarize
            <ul>
                <li>Take that 5-10 minute break when you need to/lose focus</li>
                <li>Get up! Walk around, do something</li>
                <li>Watch some k-drama or something <em>foreshadow</em></li>
                <li>Disclaimer: None of the above applies if you can work for hours straight without losing focus</li>
                <li>Or you just have a different method of studying and it works ^^:)</li>
            </ul>

    <section class="bonus">
        <h3>#4 BONUS: Warmp Up</h3>
        <p>Warm up your brain and let it know what is happening with easy problems for your first practices/problems</p>
        <p>Let your brain ease into and not be put under stress</p>
    </section>

    <section class="final">
        <h3>FINAL</h3>
        <p>Reward yourself! Let yourself watch some youtube or something, k-drama <em>hehe</em>, anime, anything to help reward yourself for studying.
            Personally for me, watching Start-Up motivates me to be productive after I finish an episode.</p> 
            <p>Another thing is rewarding yourself with more electronics (if you already do work on your computer)
                 can just add more headaches. If you need to, just put down the phone and reward yourself with a stroll around the house or whevever you're at
