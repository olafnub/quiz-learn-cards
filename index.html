    <h2>How to study</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove distractions <em>cliche</em></li>
        <li>Set up a stopwatch!</li>
        <li>Know yourself</li>
    </ol>

    <p>#1 Remove Distractions!</p>
    <p>Setting your phone out of site, behind your computer, under your comforter/pillow, a different room</p>

    <p>#2 Set up a Stopwatch!</p>
    <p>TIme yourself with completely undistracted work, work for 10minute to 15minutes to 20minutes and keep climbing</p>
    <p>Allow yourself to stop once you're feeling you're not being productive anymore</p>

    <h3>#3 Know yourself | 20 minutes is greater than 1 hour</h3>
    <em>A 20 minute non-distracted study is way more affective than a 1 hour distracted study</em>
    <p>If you're able to power through 8 hours straight without being distracted, then you're a legend & keep doing what you're doing. But if you're someone 
        who easily gets off track, 10 minutes into a study and then you're on your phone, then also good on you too!</p>

        <p> Everyone is different and everyone has a different time of how long they can study without being distracted. Even though 10 minutes might seem quick, try staring at a clock for 10 minutes and see quick it is.</p>
    <h4>Your 10 minutes can be improved with practice!</h4>
